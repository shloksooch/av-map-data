# Contributing to AV Map Data

This dataset tracks autonomous vehicle deployments and powers [avmap.io](https://avmap.io). We accept data from anywhere in the world.

## Quick Start

**Most common contribution:** Adding a new service announcement or launch

**Prefer to email your updates?** Send CSV or changes to [jackson@avmap.io](mailto:jackson@avmap.io) - see [below](#questions-or-simpler-contribution-method) for details.

**Contributing via GitHub:**
1. Edit `events.csv` to add your data (use Excel or a text editor)
2. Submit a pull request
3. We'll review and merge your changes

See [Adding a new service](#adding-a-new-service) for examples.

### Editing the CSV

You can edit `events.csv` with:
- **Excel/Google Sheets:** Open the file, add your row, save as "CSV UTF-8" - Excel handles the formatting automatically
- **Text editor:** Any text editor works - just make sure to quote any field that contains commas, quotes, newlines, or semicolons (e.g., city names like `"Grand Rapids, MI"` or multi-value fields like `"Waymo;Uber"`). When in doubt, quote it

**Excel tip:** When saving as CSV, choose "CSV UTF-8" format. Excel will automatically quote fields that need it (like URLs or text with commas). Just fill in your cells normally and let Excel handle the formatting.

## GitHub workflow (optional - you can email instead!)

**Don't want to deal with GitHub?** Skip this section and just [email your updates](#questions-or-simpler-contribution-method) - we're happy to handle the technical stuff for you.

**For those comfortable with GitHub:**

Pull requests should target the `staging` branch (not `main`) so we can test before going live:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a PR to the `staging` branch
5. We'll test your changes and merge if everything looks good

## How it works

Each row in `events.csv` represents **one change** to a service:

- **Service lifecycle events** (`service_testing`, `service_announced`, `service_created`) include all known attributes
- **Update events** (`geometry_updated`, `fares_policy_changed`, etc.) change only one field at a time
- All updates show the **complete new state**, not just what changed (e.g., full vehicle list, not just vehicles added)

## CSV structure

**The CSV has a header row and 18 columns of data.**

| # | Column                   | Description                | Example                                      | Required?     |

## CSV formatting rules

### Simple rules:
1. **Fill in 18 columns** (leave blank cells for missing data)
2. **Using Excel?** It handles formatting automatically - just save as "CSV UTF-8"
3. **Using a text editor?** Put quotes around any field with commas or semicolons

**Example row:**
```csv
"2025-09-10","service_created","Zoox","Las Vegas","zoox-las-vegas-boundary.geojson","Zoox Robotaxi","Zoox","No","Yes","Hub-to-Hub","Autonomous","Public",,,"https://zoox.com/",,"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/zoox-las-vegas-launch","Zoox Las Vegas service"
```

### Tips:
- Leave blank cells for data you don't have - that's okay!
- Put URLs in columns 15-17, notes (text only) in column 18
- Include `company_link` (15) for announcements or launches
- Only include `booking_platform_link` (16) when the platform differs from the company (e.g., Waymo on Uber) or there's a fleet partner
- Don't worry about formatting if using Excel - it handles it automatically

**Don't worry about validation** - we'll check your formatting automatically when you submit.

## Adding a new service

### Announced or testing service

For `service_testing` or `service_announced` events, only basic info required:

```csv
"2025-09-17","service_announced","Waymo","Nashville","-86.7816,36.1627",,"Lyft",,,,,,,"2026","https://waymo.com/","https://waymo.com/waymo-one/","https://waymo.com/blog/nashville","Partnership with Lyft announced"
```

Required fields (with column numbers):
- `date` (1), `event_type` (2), `company` (3), `city` (4), `source_url` (17)

All other fields can be empty but the row needs all 18 columns (just use commas for blank cells). You can add more details later using update events.

### Active service launch

For `service_created` events, fill in all service attributes:

```csv
"2025-09-10","service_created","Zoox","Las Vegas","zoox-las-vegas-september-10-2025-boundary.geojson","Zoox Robotaxi","Zoox","No","Yes","Hub-to-Hub","Autonomous","Public",,,"https://zoox.com/",,"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/zoox-opens-its-las-vegas-robotaxi-service-to-the-public","Zoox Las Vegas service"
```

Required fields (with column numbers):
- `date` (1), `event_type` (2), `company` (3), `city` (4)
- `vehicles` (6), `platform` (7), `fares` (8), `direct_booking` (9)
- `service_model` (10), `supervision` (11), `access` (12), `source_url` (17)

Optional but recommended:
- `geometry_file` (5), `fleet_partner` (13), `company_link` (15), `booking_platform_link` (16), `notes` (18)

Note: `expected_launch` (14) should be empty for `service_created` events.

## Updating a service

**Key rules for updates:**
- Always include `company` and `city` to identify the service
- **One event per field change** - if 3 things change on the same day, create 3 separate rows
- Show the **complete new state** of the field (e.g., all vehicles, not just new ones)

### Service area expansion

```csv
"2025-07-14","geometry_updated","Tesla","Austin","tesla-austin-july-14-2025-boundary.geojson",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-new-robotaxi-geofence-austin-shape-elon-musk-bigger-waymo-2025-7","Service area boundary update"
```

### Fleet update (complete new state)

```csv
"2020-10-08","vehicle_types_updated","Waymo","Phoenix",,"Jaguar I-Pace;Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/waymos-self-driving-jaguar-i-pace-vehicles-are-now-testing-on-public-roads","Vehicle fleet expansion - adding Jaguar I-Pace"
```

Note: Multiple vehicles separated by `;` (semicolon). Shows complete current fleet, not just what changed.

### Platform update (complete new state)

```csv
"2023-10-26","platform_updated","Waymo","Phoenix",,,"Waymo;Uber",,,,,,,,,,"https://waymo.com/blog/2023/10/the-waymo-driver-now-available-on-uber-in-phoenix","Booking platform update"
```

Note: Multiple platforms separated by `;` (semicolon). This allows filtering by either platform in the app.

### Policy change

```csv
"2024-11-12","access_policy_changed","Waymo","Los Angeles",,,,,,,"Public",,,,,,"https://waymo.com/blog/2024/11/waymo-one-open-to-all-in-los-angeles","Access policy update"
```

### Service model change

```csv
"2026-03-15","service_model_updated","Zoox","Las Vegas",,,,,,,"Flexible",,,,,,,"https://example.com","Service now allows flexible travel"
```

### Multiple updates on the same day

If multiple fields change on the same day, create separate events:

```csv
"2020-10-08","access_policy_changed","Waymo","Phoenix",,,,,,,"Public",,,,,,"https://waymo.com/blog/2020/10/waymo-is-opening-its-fully-driverless-service-in-phoenix","Access policy update"
"2020-10-08","fares_policy_changed","Waymo","Phoenix",,,"Yes",,,,,,,,,,,"https://waymo.com/blog/2020/10/waymo-is-opening-its-fully-driverless-service-in-phoenix","Fares policy update"
"2020-10-08","geometry_updated","Waymo","Phoenix","waymo-phoenix-october-8-2020-boundary.geojson",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://waymo.com/blog/2020/10/waymo-is-opening-its-fully-driverless-service-in-phoenix","Service area boundary update"
```

Note: Each event represents one field change, even though all three changes happened on the same day and were announced together.

## Event types

**Service lifecycle:**

- `service_testing` - Testing spotted (may be unconfirmed)
- `service_announced` - Official public announcement
- `service_created` - Service launches to public/waitlist
- `service_ended` - Service discontinued

Services progress: testing → announced → active (both testing and announcement optional)

**Required fields:**
- `service_testing` / `service_announced`: Only date, company, city, source_url
- `service_created`: All service attributes (vehicles, platform, fares, etc.)

**Service changes (must include company + changed field with complete new state):**

- `geometry_updated` - Service area changes
- `vehicle_types_updated` - Fleet changes (show complete current fleet)
- `platform_updated` - Booking platform changes (show all platforms)
- `fares_policy_changed` - Fare policy changes
- `access_policy_changed` - Access changes
- `supervision_updated` - Supervision level changes
- `flexibility_updated` - Travel flexibility changes
- `fleet_partner_changed` - Fleet partnership changes

## Lifecycle examples

```

Note: `service_testing` can precede announcement if testing is spotted first. All examples show complete 18-field format.

## Field values

Add new values when documenting companies, vehicles, platforms, or policies not listed here.

**Multi-value fields:** For `vehicles` and `platform` fields, separate multiple values with `;` (semicolon). Examples: `Waymo;Uber` or `Jaguar I-Pace;Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid`. Semicolons preserve CSV compatibility while allowing the app to filter by individual values.

**Companies:** Waymo, Tesla, Zoox, May Mobility, Cruise

**Vehicles:** Tesla Model Y, Jaguar I-Pace, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, Toyota Sienna, Zoox Robotaxi

**Platform:** Waymo, Uber, Lyft, Robotaxi, Cruise, Zoox

**Fares:** `Yes` (charges fares), `No` (free)

**Direct Booking:** `Yes` (book AV directly), `No` (may or may not get AV, like Waymo on UberX)

**Flexibility:** `Point-to-Point` (riders can travel freely between any points in the service area), `Stop-to-Stop` (riders can only travel to/from predetermined stops)

**Supervision:** `Autonomous`, `Safety Driver`, `Safety Attendant`

**Access:** `Public`, `Waitlist`

## Geometry files

Two options for specifying service locations:

### Option 1: Coordinates (for announcements or point locations)

Use inline coordinates in the `geometry_file` column (column 5).

- Format: `"longitude,latitude"` (e.g., `"-97.7431,30.2672"`)
- ⚠️ **lng,lat order** (NOT lat,lng) - longitude first!

Example (with all 18 fields):
```csv
"2025-09-16","service_created","Example Co","Austin","-97.7431,30.2672","Example Vehicle","Example Platform","Yes","Yes","Flexible","Autonomous","Public",,,"https://example.com/","https://example.com/book","https://source.com/article","Service launch at specific location"
```

### Option 2: GeoJSON boundary files (for service areas)

If adding service area boundaries, you can create them with free tools:
- **[geojson.io](https://geojson.io)** - Draw boundaries on a map, copy the GeoJSON
- **[pictomap.app](https://pictomap.app)** - Create boundaries from images or maps
- **Google Earth** - Draw a polygon, export as KML, convert to GeoJSON

Once you have a GeoJSON file:

1. Save it in the `geometries/` folder
2. Name it: `{company}-{city}-{month}-{day}-{year}-boundary.geojson`
   - Example: `waymo-austin-march-4-2025-boundary.geojson`
3. Reference it in your CSV row (column 5)

**Expected GeoJSON format:**
```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[[lng, lat], [lng, lat], ...]]
      },
      "properties": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** Both `Polygon` and `MultiPolygon` geometry types work. Tools like geojson.io will create the correct format automatically.

## Safety incidents (`incidents.csv`)

`incidents.csv` is a separate, additive dataset for safety-relevant
events: crashes, near misses, recalls, investigations, and regulatory
actions. It is intentionally kept apart from `events.csv` (deployment
state) so the two never conflate. Only publicly reported, verifiable
incidents from established sources should be added, and every row must
include a working `source_url`.

### Columns (10 total)

| # | Column | Description | Example |
|---|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | `date` | ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2023-10-02` |
| 2 | `company` | Must match a `company` value used in `events.csv` | `Cruise` |
| 3 | `city` | Match `events.csv` city when possible | `San Francisco` |
| 4 | `incident_type` | One of: `crash`, `near_miss`, `stranded`, `recall`, `investigation`, `regulatory_action`, `software_issue`, `other` | `crash` |
| 5 | `severity` | One of: `minor`, `moderate`, `serious`, `fatal`, `property_damage_only`, `unknown` | `serious` |
| 6 | `injuries` | Integer, `0` if none, blank if unknown | `1` |
| 7 | `fatalities` | Integer, `0` if none | `0` |
| 8 | `source_type` | One of: `nhtsa_sgo`, `state_dot`, `company_blog`, `news_report`, `ntsb`, `court_filing` | `news_report` |
| 9 | `source_url` | Link to the primary source | `https://...` |
| 10 | `summary` | 1-2 sentences, max 300 chars. Quote if it contains commas. | `"A Cruise robotaxi dragged a pedestrian..."` |

### Rules

- **Verifiable only.** No rumor, no social-media-only reports. NHTSA SGO,
  NTSB, state DOT, court filings, company posts, or established news.
- **Do not editorialize.** State what happened and let the source speak.
  We are logging incidents transparently, not scoring operators.
- **One incident per row.** A recall covering many cities is still one row
  (use the headquarters/primary city).
- Keep `incidents.csv` independent of `events.csv` — do not cross-write.

## Validation (Optional)

Want to test your changes locally before submitting? Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Don't worry if you skip this** - pull requests run validation automatically via GitHub Actions, and we'll help fix any issues.

## Schema changes (Advanced)

Schema is defined in [.dev/schema.json](.dev/schema.json). To add columns/event types:
1. Edit `.dev/schema.json` (add definitions), bump version
2. Run `python3 scripts/check_schema_version.py`
3. Tests auto-update from schema - no manual test changes needed

## Questions or simpler contribution method?
